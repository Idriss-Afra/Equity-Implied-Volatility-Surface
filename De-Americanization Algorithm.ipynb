With early exercise and discrete dividends, American prices do not satisfy European put–call parity, which complicates the inference of forwards and dividend expectations from observed prices.\n",

    "To estimate implied forwards and dividends, we follow this workflow:\n",
    "1. Model the American early-exercise feature with a binomial tree.\n",

    "3. Convert market American prices into European-equivalent prices by subtracting this premium (de-americanization).\n",

    "American options may be exercised before expiration, so their prices generally do not satisfy European put–call parity. Consequently, American call and put quotes cannot be used directly to infer forwards and dividends. The procedure below de-americanizes market quotes by removing an estimated early-exercise premium, constructs European-equivalent prices, and then implies the forward by parity. When discrete dividends are present, the algorithm bootstraps the cash dividend whose ex-dividend date is the last one strictly before the given option expiry $T$.\n",

    "To test and validate the implementation, we rely on a fully synthetic numerical setup. This choice is motivated by the strong sensitivity of the de-americanization procedure to market data quality: small inconsistencies or microstructure noise in American quotes can materially affect implied volatilities, early-exercise premia, and the resulting forward and dividend estimates. In addition, obtaining high-quality, internally consistent American option datasets with reliable dividend and rate inputs is often difficult without paid data sources. A controlled synthetic environment therefore provides a clean benchmark, allowing us to verify convergence, stability, and internal consistency of the pipeline before applying it to real market data."
